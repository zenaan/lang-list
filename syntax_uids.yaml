# To have a new syntax_uid added to the list, send (preferably) a GitHub pull request, or send
# an email to github-pull-requests(AT)freedbms.net
#
# BUT - do check groups of related languages, e.g.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_markup_languages
# and think about adding a group of languages, with a common prefix, rather than just one.

# Namespace: There is some minimal initial namespaceing (besides the "obs_"/obsolete and
# "unk"/unknown defaults) namely the following prefixes:
#   - asm_ for all ASM syntaxes
#   - basic_ for all BASIC languages
#   - eda_ for all Electronic Design Automation and Hardware Description Language syntaxes
#   - git_ and various other ${APPLICATION}_ prefixes
#   - html_ and various other ${MARKUP_LANG}_ prefixes
#   - perl_ and various other ${LANGUAGE}_ prefixes
#   - sql_ for all SQL dialects
#   - unix_, collecting a number of (but not all) unix config files
#
# The open question is, should literally EVERYTHING be namespaced in this way, due to the fact
# that there are literally 1000s of languages, syntaxes and file formats?
#
# And consequently, keep the existing list as mostly or entirely aliases?
#
# Or implement some other scoping/namespacing mechanism?
#
# Or just run with the below, and expand/deprecate as deemed necessary?

# Each syntax_uid key (in the map named "uids") identifies a computer language for the purposes
# of syntax highlighting.  This reflects the lang-list and EditorConfig focus on the end user.
#
# This list is based on the Vim syntax highlighting list, a list of ~600 syntax rulesets
# (basically regexes), with some dating back many years - the oldest could be monk.vim:
# Last Change: April 30, 1998, so, many of the entries may need to be moved to the
# "obsolete" section near the top; TODO.
#
# Mappings from syntax_uid to an editor's syntax language name (or "file format" or etc), where
# the syntax_uid key exists for your editor/application, but is for a different language syntax,
# MUST have an entry included in the app_maps/my_editor.yaml file.  E.g. Vim does not have a
# syntax file for "StringTemplate" templates for which the syntax_uid is "st" - in Vim, "st"
# refers to Smalltalk.  UPDATE: The simplest and safest solution is, for your $EDITOR, provide a
# mapping in app_maps/$EDITOR.yaml for EVERY supported syntax/filetype - those not present in
# the $EDITOR map, are not supported by that $EDITOR; this simplifies one of the jobs of plugin
# authors.
#
# (OLD/OUTDATED: This implies we need versioned syntax_uid releases if we wish to allow
# "fallback" to the syntax_uid by default, if your editor does not have an app_maps/ entry for
# that syntax, OR, mandate that every language an app supports MUST have an entry for each
# supported syntax_uid - this might be safest, YES, this is the rule.)
#
# We also _may_ need a mechanism/field for deprecation of a syntax_uid.
#
# This is not the place for "alternatives" syntax highlighting profiles for the same syntax;
# for such, some other mechanism must be provided; see e.g. Vim's "printcap.vim" and "ptcap.vim"
# syntax files where each appear to support printcap syntax (whilst  only the latter officially
# supports termcap files).

# About bike shedding: There are many ways to create such uids, e.g.:
#   - defacto_filename_extension (mostly 3 letters, MUCH overlap)
#
#   - category_extension (still some overlap)
#
#   - giving first/pride of place to LIBRE/FLOSS software, prepending or appending company name
#     to proprietary formats (but bear in mind some proprietary formats have had FLOSS
#     implementations after many years, and/or have become FLOSSed, e.g. Blender)
#
#   - giving program name pride of place, append _conf, _desc, _etc.
#
#   - using the format name (inserting underscores for spaces etc) as primary
#
#   - adding extras to disambiguate
#
#   - language ontology buffs with a librarian bent, may well wish to climb Mount Everest and
#     create an encyclopaedic declarative database, and such would indeed be nice to have; that
#     will take time and planning, though if/when such a beast arrives, it will almost certainly
#     provide a more ordered and "professional" set of UIDs
#
# Ultimately, this list is about a UID for computer syntaxes, in order to uniquely ID each
# syntax of interest, in the first instance for EditorConfig which must handle many syntaxii,
# and the list can contain any number of such UIDs, sufficient for the purposes at hand.
