# This software is copyrighted, see the file "LICENSE" for copyright, use and distribution terms.

# This is an example of an app_maps/application.yaml map file.
#
# It is a simple YAML map, containing:
#
#   - A protocol number (see the file protocol.txt for the current protocol number).
#
#   - A version number (initially 0) which in general should be increased for each new public
#     release of this file.
#
#   - A release date, for the date on which this version was deemed.
#
#   - A map named lang_uid_to, mapping lang_uid keys to the following (both optional) keys:
#
#     - map: "your application's corresponding language identifier"
#
#     - run: ["first app specific config command", "next command"...]
#
# Although both "map" and "run" are optional, the "lang_uid:" key should always be included, to
# simplify maintenance and help identify possible problems.
#
# "run" is optional and should be used sparingly, though it may be a useful way to tell your
# application or editor how to set an appropriate syntax or computer language.
#
# For a full (and current) example, look at the app_maps/vim.yaml file, from which the below
# examples are taken.
